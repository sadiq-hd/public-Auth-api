Overview
This project provides a secure system for user registration, login, and password recovery with OTP (One-Time Password) verification, using ASP.NET Core. Itâ€™s designed as a reference for students and developers aiming to build high-security environments for authentication, leveraging ASP.NET Identity, JWT, and other modern technologies.

Features
Secure User Registration: Ensures user identity through phone number validation before account creation.
OTP-based Login: Adds an extra security layer with OTP-based authentication.
Password Recovery: Allows users to securely reset passwords using OTP.
Full User Management: Create, update, and delete accounts with phone numbers as primary identifiers.
Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core: For building the web API and managing requests.
C#: The primary programming language for backend logic.
Entity Framework Core: For database operations and ORM.
ASP.NET Identity: To handle authentication and user management.
JWT (JSON Web Token): To generate secure tokens for user sessions.
RESTful API: For standardized HTTP requests and responses.
SQL Server: For data storage and user information management.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
.NET SDK (6.0 or later)
SQL Server for database setup
Optional: Postman for API testing
Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Setup the Database:

Update the appsettings.json file with your SQL Server connection string:
json
Copy code
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_database;User Id=your_user;Password=your_password;"
}
Run database migrations to create necessary tables:
bash
Copy code
dotnet ef database update
Run the Project:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run
Test the API:

Use tools like Postman or curl to test endpoints.
